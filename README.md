# suplex

This is a small command-line app to help with solving and visualizing substitution ciphers. There's not much more to it than that. After running it, it will ask you for a string to work on, and a character delimiter (optional and, in the case of most substitution ciphers, none). Enter `help` at the main menu for more info on available commands.

## Installation

`npm install suplex -g`
